Parallelized and Accelerated Algorithms
=======================================

This repository contains accelerated versions of some mainstream algorithms used in computer science.

There are 2 ways to achieve that:

- Reducing Space and/or time complexity with smarter programming.
- Parallelizing onto High performance rigs such as GPUs and Multicore CPUs.

NB: Obviously, combining these 2 approaches is possible.

Public sharing and collective commitment will allow us to tackle issues related to architecture changes (especially for GPU programming).
